A simple animated web app showing Santa and his reindeer flying across the sky with snowflakes and fireworks. 🎅🦌🎆 This
web app will bring holiday joy to your visitors. Ho, ho, ho! 🎅 Merry Christmas! 🎄

## 📝 Overview

This project is a Dockerized web application served via **Nginx**. It includes interactive animations created with *
*p5.js** and incorporates fun elements such as:

- Animated falling snowflakes ❄️
- Flying Santa and reindeer 🦌
- Exploding fireworks 🎆
- Merry Christmas message with glowing effects ✨
- Background music and an interactive *"Ho Ho Ho"* sound effect 📢

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive animations**: Watch Santa and his reindeer soar across the sky with dynamic snowflakes and fireworks.
- **Background Music**: Starts when the user interacts with the screen.
- **Ho Ho Ho Sound**: Play a spooky 'Ho Ho Ho' sound when tapping the screen again.
- **Responsive Design**: Full-screen experience optimized for different devices.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: Easy to run and serve using Docker and Nginx.

## 📦 Prerequisites

To run the web app locally, ensure you have:

- **Docker** installed on your machine.
- A registered domain/subdomain for external access (e.g., `xmas.domain`).

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/betazetadev/merry-christmas-2024.git

   ```

2. **Create Required Files**:
   Ensure your audio files (`christmas_song.mp3` and `hohoho.mp3`) are placed in the `assets` folder.

3. **Build and Run Docker Containers**:
   Use Docker Compose to start the app:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access the App**:
   Open your browser and visit:
   ```
   http://localhost:9090
   ```
   Or use your configured subdomain (e.g., `xmas.domain`).

5. **Stop the Containers**:

## 🌐 Deployment

To make the app publicly accessible:

1. Configure your subdomain (e.g., `xmas.domain`) to point to your server's IP address.
2. Update the `nginx/default.conf` file to include the correct server name.
3. Rebuild and restart the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```
